## Situation

The entire TPM team at GitHub was fully committed to a portfolio of existing programs.
At the same time, GitHub leadership [kept asking for rapid TPM support](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQcpNhOQvyvVCIwSSiIrUr58PcaTftCpXzjePcV4mw7n-omPv6a-7j_NMqwGHt-Q-_-Hi0OAakXKeTJ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000&slide=id.g2f7ef622387_0_51) to address specific, urgent problems.
I could either:

* Say no? Not to the CTO when it's urgent.
* Yank someone off their important program and stick them on an important project.
  This happened several times and was **very** disruptive.
  After all, programs are, by definition, focused on strategic outcomes.

## Behavior

Understanding that the urgent needs wouldn't go away, I dedicated 3 TPMs (10% of my team's capacity) to a new entity called The Flex Team for a 6 month experiment.

The hypothesis: it was better for GitHub to have experienced TPMs sitting on the bench waiting for ~something to go wrong~ an urgent need, that to disrupt strategic programs mid-flight.

We created a dedicated comms channel with our CTO (`#flex-team`) and established a rule: anyone could _ask_ for help from this dedication team, but only the CTO had the ability to say "Do it!"

The Flex Team handled several high urgency, high importance projects in the 6 months that it was fully funded.
The projects included responding to an urgent security issue involving a large number of team at GitHub.
The issue was resolved rapidly due to TPM coordination across hundreds of Hubbers across tens of Engineering and Product teams.

## Impact

* **Immediate success.** Critical projects were staffed withing minutes-to-hours, with systems and processes being in _measurably_ better shape within days-to-single digit weeks.
* **Long-term sustainability.** We learned something: the types of issues that came up repeatedly turned out to be areas of underinvestment.
  So over time I spun up dedicated programs for those areas---security, availability, scalability---and the Flex Team TPMs transitioned to full-time leaders of those programs.
