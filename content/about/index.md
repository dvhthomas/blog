Hi, I'm Dylan Thomas üëã  My legal name is Dominic Thomas but Dylan is a poetry-related[^poetry] nickname that I've had since I was a teen.
I respond to both Dylan and Dominic üòÅ

## Formerly English, Currently American

I immigrated to the USA many years ago and I've spent more than half of my life here.
As a result, I sound like a mixed up American with the occasional British-ism.

For example,I say `to-MAH-toe` üçÖ rather than `tu-MAY-toe` and I still say `YOG-urg` rather than `YO-gurg`.
I _still_ can't wrap my head around the American version of those two words üò¨

## People first and then the machines

Professionally I describe myself as a technologist, with a focus on both cloud-based products and things with a geospatial twist.

I've coded for money, but I'm really all about using any technology[^sed] to solve problems.
I really like to **start with the people and eventually get to the machines**.
If you're not solving a problem for somebody or some class of people, you're not doing it right.
There are probably exceptions to that principle, but I find it's a good place to start.

I've also learned that **working in the open by default** is a superpower both individually and collectively.
Working at GitHub---the home of open source software---was a revelation in that regard (hat tip to [Ben](https://github.com/benbalter)).
It confirmed by fundamental belief that writing things down _as publicly as possible_ is [a game changer](https://ben.balter.com/2015/11/12/why-urls/).

## Learning My Way Through a Career

I am an incurable and curious tinkerer, which I believe is a strength in my work.
The **ability and desire to learn** got me from being a geographer in both [the UK](http://www.reading.ac.uk/ges) and [the USA](https://geoearth.charlotte.edu) to things as varied as:

* Sales engineering with [Esri](https://www.esri.com)
* [Consulting software developer](https://woolpert.com) with municipal utilities
* Building social features into [MSN](https://www.msn.com) and [Bing](https://www.bing.com)
* Starting [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com) customer success
* Launching [Android Auto](https://www.android.com/auto/) in 70M vehicles
* [Building]({{< relRef "series/woolpert-cloud-journey/" >}}) a Cloud consulting product and practice
* [Leading](http://localhost:1313/2024/10/tpm-journey-at-github/) the TPM team at GitHub through major product and platform shifts.
* Having a life by taking two sabbaticals as **Head of DadOps** for my family.

[^poetry]: [Dylan Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Thomas) being a famous Welsh poet.
  I've been known to [read](https://poets.org/poem/fern-hill) a bit during [seasonal social events](https://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks07/0701261h.html) at work
[^sed]: My proudest early moment in the 1990s was piping a 60MB file through a [`sed`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sed) command. It worked so darn fast that I spent 20 minutes trying to figure out what has gone 'wrong' üòÖ
