## Work Experience

### Sabbatical

_Remote_

#### Head of DadOps

_June 2025 to Present_

- My sabbatical is focused on Dad Operations (DadOps) as I lead the Thomas family towards high performance!
- University tours, a structured approach to high school, and ensuring that the home network is up to the rigors of both gaming and the home office.
- I'm also finally getting to learn more about AI fundamentals in the [ByteByteGo AI Engineering course]({{< relref "/series/ai-engineering-course" >}}).
  [Agentic patterns, too](https://github.com/dvhthomas/agent-learn).

### GitHub

_Remote_

#### Head of Technical Program Management (TPM)

_Jan 2022 to June 2025_

- **GHES Releases are Boring.** [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.18/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-server) (GHES) is responsible for a sizable percentage of GitHub's revenue.
  In early 2022 each release was stressful and at risk of being late to demanding customers.
  I led a small team of TPMs to provide clear expectations and repeatable processes for all GitHub feature teams: timeframes, quality bar, and communication channels.
  By mid-2023 most [releases](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.18/admin/all-releases) were on time and contained few regressions, enabling the GHES team to focus more on net new features for customers.
  There was no clear ownership so I took responsibility to get product buy-in, engineering funding, and budget approval for certification testing.
- **PRC Compliance.** GitHub's certification to sell in the People's Republic of China (PRC) hinged on [compliance with a country-specific UTF encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_18030).
  As a result, GitHub achieved GB18030 compliance each year my team ran the program, thus protecting our revenue stream in the PRC.
- **Strategic focus.** When I joined GitHub, a team of 30+ TPMs was working on 20+ programs and projects.
  I introduced a regular review of strategic need against investments made, thus putting more TPM investment into programs with the biggest impact.
  The [cut line](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQcpNhOQvyvVCIwSSiIrUr58PcaTftCpXzjePcV4mw7n-omPv6a-7j_NMqwGHt-Q-_-Hi0OAakXKeTJ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000&slide=id.g2f82f98138f_0_15) was painful, necessary, and agreed upon by VP+ stakeholders.
  By early 2025 GitHub TPM was running 5 major programs with ~30 TPMs focused _solely_ on major company goals including [security](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/05/03/security-above-all-else-expanding-microsofts-secure-future-initiative/), [Copilot AI](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/18/github-launches-a-free-version-of-its-copilot/), and [enterprise data residency](https://github.com/enterprise/data-residency).
- **Rapid response at scale.** Created the Flex Team---a dedicated squad of 3 TPMs---to handle urgent, high-impact projects without disrupting ongoing programs. **Critical projects were staffed within minutes-to-hours**, with systems and processes measurably improved within days-to-weeks. For example, I staffed a project within 60 minutes of getting an urgent text message about an active security concern, our small team was actively coordinating the response with 2 hours.

### Woolpert

_Remote_

#### Cloud Solutions Director

_Jan 2019 to Jan 2022_

- **Leadership with EQ.** Defined brand new roles and [ways of working]({{< ref "blog/2021/06/15/how-we-work/index.md" >}}) within a traditional corporate environment. Psychological safety, a culture of learning, and goals based on reality rather than hope.
- **Scaling teams.** Hired a team of 12 engineers as both team leads and individual contributors. Established a repeatable hiring process with [core and technical skill components]({{< ref "blog/2019/01/29/core-skills-ge-tech-skills/index.md" >}}) and a high bar. Established an org chart that can scale.
- **Technical delivery.** Closed and delivered consulting engineering work worth $450,000.
  Established pre-award R&D goals, work estimation, co-authored the technical proposal, and led agile project delivery with Google as my client.
- **Product.** Formed and led the team that defined, built, and sold our [first SaaS product](https://woolpert.com/stream-raster/).
  As product leader I defined the SLOs and SLAs, directed the engineering team daily, and directed all aspects of go to market.
- **Acquisitions.** Technical reviewer for acquisitions, providing valued input on GO/NOGO decisions related to technical risk, technical staff, and product roadmap feasibility.
- **Open source.** Led the effort to release our [first open source solution](https://woolpert.com/news/press-releases/woolpert-launches-geoawareness-solution-for-curbside-pickup-upon-arrival/), GeoAwareness.

### Google

_Remote and Mountain View, California_

#### Head of Partner Engineering, Android Automotive --- _2014-2018_

- **Leadership.** Founding team member 2014, global lead from 2015. I built and led a global hybrid remote team of 15+ technical staff. We got [Android Auto](https://www.android.com/auto/) embedded and shipping with 75+ industry partners in 130+ head unit variants in the first 24 months.
- **Global technology partnerships.** Fully accountable for the first global Android automotive engineering partnerships with most OEMs and their entire Tier 1 supply chains. Influencing platform and hardware/software roadmaps across an industry.
-  **Scaling technical delivery.** Formulated the reproducible certification process applicable to all partners and internal teams, thus scaling certification throughput. This ultimately led me to start a 3rd Party Labs ("3PL") outsourced certification program to dramatically increase the reach of the product.
-  **Technical thought leadership.** The auto industry has a strong driver safety focus, leading to numerous one-off conversations with Android UX and PM. I codified those nascent discussions into an unambiguous, holistic spec using clear [RFC2119-style](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) language.
-  **Technical clarity.** Led and contributed to an effort to clarify the Android Auto protocol-level integration spec resulting in: an improved test suite to cover all `MUST` cases; greater clarity for all engineers integrating Android Auto into their head units.
-  **Corporate citizenship.** Sat on TPM hiring committee reviewing 50+ candidate packages for hire/no hire decisions, and personally interviewed 70+ technical and non-technical candidates.

#### Google Maps Program Manager --- _2012-2014_

- **Program Leadership.** Founder of Geo Customer Success Services; I provided leadership for the practice, including program management and project execution. On a day-to-day basis I served as a technical advisor and advocate for strategic Google Maps OEMs, touching 27% of Geo revenue and key name brands.
- **2013 Enterprise Operations Chief of Staff.** As a successful program manager I was selected for one of four global spots on the OCS leadership rotation in Singapore. Covered six countries in six weeks with great international business exposure alongside Google's regional leadership team.
