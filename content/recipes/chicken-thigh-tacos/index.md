summary: |-
  With the adobo sauce and chilli these are on the spicier end of what my kids will eat. But there are really quick to make and with crema and toppings it takes the edge off.

This is a very easy recipe to double.

### Ingredients

{{< ingredients >}}
- 1.5 pounds chicken thighs
- 1 4-6oz can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1 lime, juiced
- 2 tbsp olive oil
{{< /ingredients >}}

### Instructions

{{< instructions >}}

**Marinade chicken:** In a zip bag or marinating bowl, combine the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, 1 teaspoon cumin, and the juice of 1 lime.
The marinade will be discarded afterward.
Marinate the chicken thighs for 15 to 20 minutes or overnight in the fridge.

**Cook and rest:** Heat a large pan over medium-high heat.
Once hot, add the olive oil and distribute it around to coat.
Place the chicken thighs on the pan, allowing some room between them, and cook for about 7 minutes per side. You know chicken thighs are ready when the internal temperature measured with a meat thermometer reaches 175F.

**:** Remove the chicken thighs from the pan onto a cutting board.
Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes before slicing.
Slice the thighs diagonally and again into small pieces.

### Notes

**Storage:** Airtight refrigerated container for 2 days.

**Variations:** Put the same amount of adobo sauce but not all of the chillis from the can. That'll reduce the heat a little bit for those who prefer milder flavors.

**Tips:** These go very well with finely diced red onion and chopped cilantro.
And [crema](https://downshiftology.com/recipes/lime-crema/)!
