The key here is patience: a long, **gradual sear** to build color and flavor, followed by a gentle braise until the meat yields completely. See [the original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_wzy7qcahI) for the full demonstration.

### Instructions

#### Cook

**Sear the short ribs:** Heat a large, heavy-based casserole dish over medium heat. Add vegetable oil and sear the short rib portions well for 15-20 minutes. **Go slow here**—not hard and fast, but gradual—building a deep, even color on all sides.

**Sauté the aromatics:** Remove the meat from the pan. Add the diced carrot, onion, celery, garlic, and thyme. Cook until softened and fragrant.

**Deglaze and braise:** Return the meat to the pan. Add the red wine and reduce fully. Add the chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Cover with a cartouche (a circle of parchment pressed directly on the surface) and transfer to a preheated oven at 160°C (320°F). Braise for 2 to 2.5 hours. The meat is ready when a thin spoon handle can pierce it with minimal resistance.

**Rest and press:** Remove the casserole from the oven. Allow the meat to rest and cool in the braising liquor. Once cool enough to handle, remove the bones—they should slip out with ease. Place the meat bone-side up between two heavy trays and weight it down. Refrigerate until fully chilled, then trim into even rectangles.

#### Warm Up

**Make the sauce:** Strain the braising liquor through a fine mesh sieve. Reduce by three-quarters until glossy and deeply flavored.

**Reheat and serve:** Bring some reduced sauce and a splash of chicken stock to a boil in a sauté pan. Remove from heat and place the short rib portions in the pan. Transfer to a 220°C (430°F) fan-assisted oven for 10-14 minutes until the meat is glazed and heated through.

### Notes

**Storage:** The braised and pressed short ribs keep well refrigerated for up to 3 days. The reduced sauce can be stored separately. This makes it an excellent make-ahead dinner party dish.

**Variations:** Serve with duchess potatoes as in the original recipe, or alongside creamy mashed potatoes, or polenta.

**Tips:** The pressing step is essential for presentation—it compacts the meat and allows you to cut clean portions.
