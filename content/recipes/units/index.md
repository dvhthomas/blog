## Volume: US to Metric

| US Measure | Milliliters (mL) | Notes |
|------------|------------------|-------|
| 1/8 tsp | 0.6 mL | Pinch |
| 1/4 tsp | 1.25 mL | |
| 1/2 tsp | 2.5 mL | |
| 1 tsp | 5 mL | |
| 1 tbsp | 15 mL | = 3 tsp |
| 1/8 cup | 30 mL | = 2 tbsp |
| 1/4 cup | 60 mL | = 4 tbsp |
| 1/3 cup | 80 mL | |
| 1/2 cup | 120 mL | = 8 tbsp |
| 2/3 cup | 160 mL | |
| 3/4 cup | 180 mL | |
| 1 cup | 240 mL | |
| 1 pint | 480 mL | = 2 cups |
| 1 quart | 950 mL | = 4 cups |
| 1 gallon | 3.8 L | = 16 cups |

## Weight: US/Imperial to Metric

| Ounces | Pounds | Grams | Kilograms |
|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| 1/2 oz | — | 14 g | — |
| 1 oz | — | 28 g | — |
| 2 oz | — | 57 g | — |
| 4 oz | 1/4 lb | 113 g | — |
| 8 oz | 1/2 lb | 227 g | — |
| 12 oz | 3/4 lb | 340 g | — |
| 16 oz | 1 lb | 454 g | 0.45 kg |
| 32 oz | 2 lbs | 907 g | 0.9 kg |
| — | 5 lbs | 2.3 kg | 2.3 kg |

## Temperature: Fahrenheit to Celsius

| °F | °C | Gas Mark | Oven Description |
|----|-------|----------|------------------|
| 225 | 107 | 1/4 | Very cool / Very slow |
| 250 | 121 | 1/2 | Very cool / Very slow |
| 275 | 135 | 1 | Cool / Slow |
| 300 | 149 | 2 | Cool / Slow |
| 325 | 163 | 3 | Warm / Moderate |
| 350 | 177 | 4 | Moderate |
| 375 | 191 | 5 | Moderately hot |
| 400 | 204 | 6 | Hot |
| 425 | 218 | 7 | Hot |
| 450 | 232 | 8 | Very hot |
| 475 | 246 | 9 | Very hot |
| 500 | 260 | 10 | Extremely hot |

**Quick mental math**: For oven temps, subtract 30 from Fahrenheit and halve it to get approximate Celsius. Example: 350°F → (350-30)/2 = 160°C (actual: 177°C, close enough for most recipes).

## Common Ingredients by Weight

Useful when converting volume measurements to weight for precision. These are approximate and can vary by ingredient brand and how densely packed the ingredient is.

### Flours

| Ingredient | 1 cup | 1 tbsp |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| All-purpose flour | 120 g | 8 g |
| Bread flour | 127 g | 8 g |
| Cake flour | 114 g | 7 g |
| Whole wheat flour | 120 g | 8 g |

### Sugars

| Ingredient | 1 cup | 1 tbsp |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Granulated sugar | 200 g | 12 g |
| Brown sugar (packed) | 220 g | 14 g |
| Powdered sugar | 120 g | 8 g |
| Honey | 340 g | 21 g |
| Maple syrup | 315 g | 20 g |

### Fats

| Ingredient | 1 cup | 1 tbsp |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Butter | 227 g | 14 g |
| Oil (vegetable, olive) | 220 g | 14 g |
| Shortening | 190 g | 12 g |

### Dairy

| Ingredient | 1 cup | 1 tbsp |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Milk (whole) | 244 g | 15 g |
| Heavy cream | 240 g | 15 g |
| Sour cream | 240 g | 15 g |
| Yogurt | 245 g | 15 g |

### Other Common Ingredients

| Ingredient | 1 cup | 1 tbsp |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Water | 240 g | 15 g |
| Cocoa powder | 85 g | 5 g |
| Rolled oats | 90 g | 6 g |
| Rice (uncooked) | 185 g | 12 g |
| Chocolate chips | 170 g | 11 g |
| Nuts (chopped) | 125 g | 8 g |

## Butter Stick Conversions (US)

US butter comes in sticks, which can be confusing for metric recipes:

- 1 stick = 1/2 cup = 8 tbsp = 4 oz = 113 g
- 2 sticks = 1 cup = 16 tbsp = 8 oz = 227 g
- 4 sticks = 2 cups = 1 lb = 454 g

Most sticks have tablespoon markings on the wrapper for easy measuring.

## Pan Size Conversions

Common US baking pans and their metric equivalents:

| US Size | Metric (cm) | Volume |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| 9×5 inch loaf | 23×13 cm | ~1.5 L |
| 8×8 inch square | 20×20 cm | ~2 L |
| 9×9 inch square | 23×23 cm | ~2.5 L |
| 9×13 inch | 23×33 cm | ~3.5 L |
| 9 inch round | 23 cm | ~1.5 L |
| 10 inch round | 25 cm | ~2 L |

## Practical Tips

**For volume conversions**: US cups are 240 mL, not 250 mL. This matters in baking. If a metric recipe calls for 250 mL, that's slightly more than 1 US cup.

**For weight**: Baking by weight (grams) is more accurate than volume (cups), especially for flour. Different people pack flour differently into cups, but 120g is always 120g.

**For temperatures**: Most ovens fluctuate ±25°F from the set temperature. Use an oven thermometer if precision matters.

**Scaling recipes**: When doubling or halving, most ingredients scale linearly, but be careful with salt, spices, and leavening agents (baking powder/soda) - these sometimes need adjustment beyond simple multiplication.
