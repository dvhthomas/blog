Nastya's batter calls for more sugar but I think 1 tablespoon of sugar is enough.
And crepe batter is a lot runnier and looser than a typical American-style pancake batter.
It's essential that it can easily flow across the griddle.

- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Instructions

**Prep your ingredients:** Stick the butter in the microwave for 10 seconds until mostly melted.

**Blend and rest:** Put all of the ingredients in a blender and pulse to mix then blend for 30 seconds. Let it rest for at least 10 minutes. In the meantime, put your crepe griddle on a medium heat and let it come up to temperature, which will also take 10 minutes.

**Cook:** Lightly oil the crêpe griddle. Use a 1/4 cup measure to pour the batter onto the griddle then **immediate** pick up the griddle and aggressively roll in in a circular motion, ensuring that the entire griddle is coated in a thin layer. After 30-90 seconds use an offset spatulate to release the crepe from the pan and flip it.

**Eat immediately:** We serve them with compote made by cooking fruit down with sugar, bananas, Nutella, cheese, salmon, lemon juice, cheese...basically anything tastes good in a warm, slightly sweet-salty crepe.

### Notes

**Storage:** We use a plastic [tortilla warmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortilla_warmer) to keep all the crepes warm until we're ready to serve them. The 10.5" crepe griddle has burrito-size results. They keep well for one day in the refrigerator.
